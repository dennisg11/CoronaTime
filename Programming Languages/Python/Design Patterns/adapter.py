"""
Letâ€™s say you have a working method for logging information to a given destination. 
Your method expects the destination to have a write() method (as every file object has, for example).

def log(message, destination):
    destination.write('[{}] - {}'.format(datetime.now(), message))

I would say it is a well written method with dependency injection, which allows for great extensibility. 
Say you want to log to some UDP socket instead to a file,you know how to open this UDP socket but the only problem is that the socket object has no write() method. 
You need an Adapter!
